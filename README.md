# Concorde_Engine_Intake_Flows

This project investigates the aerodynamic behavior of a supersonic, variable-geometry Concorde intake system. Using compressible flow theory and Python (SciPy), it models and analyzes the impact of ramp deflection on flow properties—specifically, Mach number, static/stagnation pressures, temperature, and density—across key flow regions including oblique shocks, expansion waves, normal shock waves, and diverging nozzles. The study highlights how different ramp angles influence pressure buildup and flow deceleration, essential for optimal engine performance.
